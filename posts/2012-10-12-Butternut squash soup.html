It took me so long to get back to my blog. I was affected by flu and the only solution is to take lot of rest. For the past few years, every year I get affected by flu, so this year I thought I should get the flu shot. But guess what I got flu in the early season itself. I was too weak to cook and was thinking of liquid food to ease the sickness. Soups are the ultimate choice. It is easy to cook and I can make in large quantity and store it in fridge as well.

I am very rebellious to have Lemsip drink for flu. I can&#39;t stand its smell and it doesn&#39;t taste good. But I overcome the shortcoming by making some  wonderful soups.

Autumn season was almost there, variety of winter squashes were in season. I made butternut squash soup, it was wonderful with a mild note of curry flavour and smoothness from the addition of coconut milk. I added toasted sunflower seeds or chopped cashew nuts for the extra dimension of crunchiness to the soup.

Look out for some more soups to come in the following blog post :)
