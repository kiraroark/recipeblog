*Summary*
My holiday season started of with the making of the best beef bourguignon. This dish originated in Burgundy and its one of the popular French dish. In simple, it is a slow cooked beef stew cooked in red wine and beef stock.

Pork lardons are used as cooking fat to brown the beef, they are then removed and reserved for final addition. The beef is then slow cooked for about 2 hours in red wine and beef stock until tender. A bouquet of herbs and a garlic clove is added to flavour the stew. For garnish, saute the shallots and button mushrooms, add them to the stew at the end of the cooking along with reserved lardons. 

It tasted so delicious and rich with the beefy sauce. The beef was so tender and it was such a pleasure to have with the mushrooms and shallots. I almost forgot, I served it along with good homemade garlic baguette which is a very good combination to soak up all the lovely sauce.

*Instructions*
#For Marinating: 
In a glass mixing bowl, place the meat cubes, season with salt and pepper.
Add the sliced onions, sherry vinegar, olive oil, water and herbs to the meat, mix everything together.
Cover the bowl with cling film, place in refrigerator for atleast 5 hours. The longer marination helps in tenderising the meat.

#For Cooking:
Place a casserole pan on medium heat, add the pork lardons and let it cook until it releases oil.
Turn the heat to low, add the shallots, turn them frequently until browned.
Using a slotted spoon, remove the lardons and shallots and set them aside.
Turn the heat up, place the drained meat in the casserole pan and browned them on both sides. Add the flour and quickly stir to make it mix with the fat.
Add any leftover marinate from the bowl to the casserole pan and let it cook for a minute, then add the beef stock.
Add the dried parsley, bayleaf and garlic to the pan, cover with lid and simmer for 2 hours.
At the end of 2 hours, cook the mushroom in a fry pan with butter for 2 minutes to remove some of their moisture.
After 2 hours of simmering, add the lardons, shallots and mushroom to the casserole pan, cover and simmer for further 20 minutes.
Remove the garlic and bayleaf before serving.
