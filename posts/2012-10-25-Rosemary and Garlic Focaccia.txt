*Summary*
What an wonderful weekend to start of with. I made the perfect rosemary &amp; garlic focaccia. I am always up for the challenge when it comes to baking bread. Most of the time, I use my electric hand mixer, which produces average result. I am still learning how to perfectly knead the bread dough by hand.

Recently, I borrowed an Italian cookbook from the library and I was too eager to tryout the focaccia. I decided to knead the dough by hand, it turned out to be a good exercise, but I realised I should have powerful muscle. After kneading for 15 minutes, I produced a perfectly smooth dough. The dough raised well during the first and second rise. I topped my focaccia mostly with fresh rosemary and garlic and a smaller portion of it with green olives and baked it to golden brown.

The freshly baked bread smell filled my house. After it had cool down a bit, I cut a piece to taste. It had many air pockets, I think my hand kneading is getting better :) . It tasted delicious with a thin crunchy top. It had nicely soaked up all the olive oil drizzled over it, intensifying the flavour with rosemary and garlic. It was one of my best focaccia so far.

Here is the picture of my Rosemary and garlic focaccia.
