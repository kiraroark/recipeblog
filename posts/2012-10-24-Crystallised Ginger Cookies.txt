*Summary*
My adventure with soups alleviated my flu recovery. After I fully recovered, I had strong craving for sugar, so I made Crystallised Ginger Cookies to formally say goodbye to flu. 

Wow, my cookie has turned out to be the finale of this whole adventure. It had a fantastic look with evenly coated granulated sugar. They were perfectly cooked with crunchy outside and soft slightly chewy texture inside and had a pleasant aroma from crystallised ginger.

*Instructions*
#
In a mixing bowl, cream together butter and light brown sugar until it is light and fluffy.
Add the beaten egg and molasses, mix until everything is well incorporated. 
Sift the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, clove and ginger into the cream mixture. Add the crystallised ginger. Mix until everything is well combined. Don't be alarmed, the mixture will be thick but it will workout.
Preheat the oven to 180C (fan).
Line the baking sheet with parchment paper, this eases the cookie removing process.
Place the granulated sugar in a plate.
Scoop a tablespoon of mixture and form into a round ball. Dip the ball into the granulated sugar, coat almost 3/4 of it. Place the ball on the baking sheet with sugar side up. Repeat this process for remaining of the mixture.
Bake in the preheat oven for 10 minutes or until little cracks appear on the top.
Remove from oven and let it cool on the wire rack.

#Notes:
Keep dough refrigerated between batches.
Use Demerara sugar to coat, they are big crystals works even better than granulated sugar. 
Let the cookies cool on the baking tray to get the perfect shape with round dome in the centre. If you try to remove from baking tray before cooling it, they will form a shallow in the middle, which isn't pretty.
